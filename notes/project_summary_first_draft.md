# project summary first draft for email to PO

## Overview

- The FreeMoCap Foundation seeks to solidify and support the self-sustaining, collaborative community of users and developers that is arising around the `freemocap` software - a free, open source markerless motion capture system capable of producing research quality kinematic data with minimal cost
- The rapid advance of machine learning techniques generates wildly impressive results on a near-daily basis, but these techniques are often poorly suited for rigorous scientific research or professional use. 
- By combining the core technology of CNN based markerless kinematic tracking with classical techniques from computational geometry, we are able to create a system for accurately recording the full-body 3d kinematics of human, animal, and robotic subjects for orders of magnitude lower cost than traditional marker-based systems. 
- Making early versions of this tool available online has attracted a growing, vibrant community of developers and end-users from diverse backgrounds, including:
    - Scientists
        - Perceptual-motor neuroscience 
        - Clinical biomechanics
        - Robotics
    - Artists
        - 3d animators (film-makers)
        - Video game designers
    - Open source software developers
        - Computer Vision
        - Machine Learning
- This proposal seeks the funding to develop the infrastrure of the FreeMoCap Foundation in order to:
    - Solidify the software infrastructure to facilitate long-term support and external contributions
    - Support and encourage communal engagement (both for end users and developers)
    - Develop solid knowledge base and documentation (with a focus on building bridges between the constituent sub-communities of users)

## Intellectual Merit

- Marker-based motion capture equipment is prohibitively expensive, even for federally funded research labs
    - It also requires significant technical expertise to use, and there is a bottle-neck of manual effort relating to the placement of markers and post-processing of data
    - It's also of limited use in outdoor, natural environments
- The `freemocap` software stands to impart a transformative effect on the fields of human-centered research by making the tools of 3d kinematics accessible to researchers and clinicians with any level of funding and technical expertise
- The FreeMoCap foundation will facilitate this change through support and organization of the development, extension, and usage of the `freemocap` software, with the goal of simultanesouly supporting its capacities for a given sub-group of users while also working to build bridges between  them

## Broader Impacts
- the `freemocap` software makes it possible for the average person to produce research quality motion capture for orders of magnitude lower cost than a traditional system. 
    - This collapse of cost opens the potential use of motion capture methods to a range of communities across a wide range of the economic spectrum. 
    - This proposal will provide the  FreeMoCap Foundation with the resources necessary to support communities of users as they learn to incorporate these new technologies into their particular area of interest
    - This support will simultaneously uplift communities that have traditionally been cut off from the advantages conferred by science and technology as they pursue their own interests, while also providing in-road and bridges that connect those communities to each other and to the more traditional areas of scientific and technological advancement.
