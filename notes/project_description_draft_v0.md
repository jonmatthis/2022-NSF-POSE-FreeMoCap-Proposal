- Github
  - 2k+ stars
  - buncha forks
- Twitter
- Twitch
- YouTube
- TikTok Kinda

>         >  -  and user base; and
>      
> - a description of the problem being addressed, and
 
 - Marker based mocap is expensive garbage 90s tech
     - super precise, but low tech solution requires huge labor (setup, post processing) bottlenecks that constrain the kinds of research that can be done (lab bound, equipment bound, etc)
 - modern comp sci makes new methods possible
     - CNN based skeleton tracking, like wow
     - open pose first, but there's a million of themm now
     - 
 - but you gotta do a lot of work to make ML based solutions 'epistemically groundded' (i.e 'reliable') enough to to generate scientific knowledge
     - that 'NN's are easily fooled' paper
     - (basically, NN's don't know when they are wrong, so you can't trust their judgement)
     - Gotta combine their very good estimates with a LOOOOT of other (more traditional) computation methods to shape those 'stats based' data with old school CV and computational geometry (i.e. synchronization, calibation, etc)
 - Also, folks got no mocap out there
     - Many applications for reliable measurements of human movement would open up if it was available to *everyone* 
         - It'd change - 
             - art 
                 - dance/circus performance
             - 3d animation
                 - film
                 - video games
             - science
                 - biomechanics
                 - neuroscience
                 - robotics
             - health
                 - physical therapy 
                 - gait/posture
                 - 'actvities of daily living'
             - 
 - so we should give it to them âœ¨
 - 
> - the novelty of the intended product being transitioned, including:
>     -  substantiating evidence of the technology's potential to significantly impact/address the problem.

- Lotta people using it:
    - V4Ndlo's vids
    - high school kids (twitter)
    - that other high school teacher that contacted me
    - Robot conductor from Florida
    - Steen Harsted's spinal biomechanics stuff
    - Mac Pribble (mprib)
    - Manitoba Mike
    - Kate's stuff
    - Chen Yu
    - Count up how many clips are in the freemocap server
    - Gotten pings from *14* differnt countries in the GUI
    - The person walking around in an empty room in what looked like a University lab 
    - Whosits at NEU doing sign language research
    - Teddy
- Analysis of website and social media traffic
    - TRENT
    - Need user surveys and whatnot

## Ecosystem Establishment/Growth:
> - Include a well-developed ecosystem` establishment/growth` and `ongoing discovery strategy` that ensures that the proposed OSE will:
>   
>     - further `develop the open-source product within the current technological landscape`, along with
>   
>     - specific plans to identify, engage and support potential users and partners who will serve as early adopters for the product`; 
>   
>         - specific plans to engage 
industrial: 
- Maurizio at IO
- Maybe Boston Dynamics?
- Epic Games
    - got a megagrant :D
    - 
and international collaborators are encouraged; 
- Steen Harsted and his thing
- website traffic very international
- gui pings from 14 countries
> 
## Organization and Governance: 
> - Describe a well-developed and sustainable `organizational`, `coordination`, and `governance` model including :

- copy what `ipython`, `numpy`, `astropy?` etc do
    - https://www.astropy.org/contribute.html
>   
>     - the licensing approach to be employed, 
- AGPLv3 - because this is such a human focused thing, people will have justifiable privacy concerns, esp w.r.t. privacy violations from video-focused social media corps (e.g. facebook, amazon, google, etc)
    - Also, there are services that use this behind a webportal, so we need the AGPL over the GPL
    - It's the same license Blender uses, and we're pretty closely aligned with them 
>     
>     - the specific continuous development, integration and deployment processes and 
 - Everything on/through/in Github
     - Use all the fancy tools and actions
     - Github competence as a 'core competency' of this project
>     - infrastructure that will enable the open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product and support sustainability goals for the OSE, along with 
>     
>     - metrics to assess and evaluate success, in the longer term, of the development methodology and 
>     
>     - processes for ensuring quality control, 
>     
>     - security and
>     
>     - privacy of new content;

- ENDURANCE 
    
## Community Building: 
> - Describe a long-term strategy for community building to `engage`, `incentivize`, and `onboard` potential content contributors who will help in further developing and maintaining the open-source product;
  - Pipeline from low -> high XP contributors
  - Identifying and onboarding power users as moderators
    - Solidifying voting system for mods
    - Identifying votable issues for mods e.g.:
      - tooling
      - process
      - prioritization
    - Determining voting scheduling e.g.
      - weekly?
      - bi-weekly?
      - async?
  - Discord support `help-requests` channel workflow
    1. Initial support request
    2. Thread created via bot integration
    3. Support request handled within thread
    4. When resolved, mark initial SR with âœ…
  - One-stop shop as prioritized backlog
    - Bot posts daily/weekly link to Github repo prioritized backlog?
  - Education as community
    - Mentorship and pairing
>     - Matching system?
    - Reward and recognition for both mentor and mentee
      - XP
      - Server level-up
      - Roles
      - Channel access unlock
    - Possibilty of pure self-education
    - Streamlined doc/readme requests?

- TLDR Takeaways

  - Implement multi-stream reward/level-up framework
  - Implement routine backlog prioritization 
  - Streamline discord support channel workflow
  - Mod voting system formalization

## Scientific Merit

> Stuff and things that will make new knowledge and make science better
## IM-1 - Create next generation of motion capture technology
- The current gold standard in motion capture tech (marker based) is garbage
    - huge labor bottlenecks on both  data recording and post processing, which limits the kind of research that can be done and wastes uncountable numbers of labor hours
        - entire careers built on placing markers and manually cleaning recorded data
        - Also hugely expensive, with minimal costs in the 5 figure range and professional labs in the 6-7 figure 
    - IMU stuff can be good, but many  many problems
    - Might be useful for cleaning our data through!
        - orthogonol noise profiles
        - optical  is 'high accuracy low precision' inertial is 'high precision low accuracy'
        - so kalman filter 'em together 
## IM-2 - Build new paradigm of  human centered research (-or- "Laser Skeletons for everyone!")
- Build better tools to interogate the neural bases of the `Activities of daily living`
- Use the tools as training tools for next generation of scientists
    - Equip them for technologically driven research
    - Engage people from diverse backgrounds (e.g. Kiley and Philip)
- Creating these tools as a collaborative community will egender deeper engagement and 'stickiness' of educational aspects
- THe comp sci community creates new techno miracles every day
- But these new technological products are often not suited for reseach purposes blah blah blah
## Broader Impacts
## BI -1 - Now everybody will have motion capture!
- So now they can do things that would previously have cost (at least!) thousands of dollars for like, $40-50  
- SO immediately there are inroads into parts of the technological and scientific world that are no longer behind a massive cost barrier
    - Coaches
    - teach biomechanics
    - teach neurosciences
    - You could put a viable gait lab in every PT's office
    - You could set up little "freemocap" corners in people's homes and record balance assesssments or like, Range of Motion of a joint after surgery 
- And it's free baby! 
## BI-2 - The technical skills that `freemocap` teachers are the tools that will build the future of science and technology
- Set it up so that you don't need to under stand the underlying components to *use* it AND using it teaches you how it works
- Distributed, decentralized, hybrid synchronous/asynchronous
    - open up things to widest spread possible
- Good case studies of 'non traditionaly educational experiences'
    - Kiley
    - Philip
    - Manitoba mike
    - high school kids
    - mac pribble




# Unstructured other notes

## Community Support

- Challenge: AS the project grows, the effort of support increases
    - Solution: Build a strongly interconnected community that can help offset challenges of growth
- Building Mod team from power users
    - training in `Constituent Components` (see Educational Content)
    - 'Entry level' work to support bringing in, on-boarding, and encouraging help from Low/No XP newbs
        - Labs really benefit when there is a lot of meaningful 'low-skill' labor to be done, as it makes a place for new people to meaningfully contribute to the project in a way that *actually* helps
            - Teach them to make tech support tickets and point people towards docs
            - ... which will teach them about the technical issues and the layout and content of the docs!
            - Create an opportunity for self-directed exploration of `Constituent Components`
            - Anyone (from any level) can train someone to do this kind of work
            - `BUDGET` - Pay for this kind of help, somehow...

- Community grants program? 
    - Internal voting via 'eurovision' model
    - Voting rights given to power users, based on accrued XP

## Technical Infrastructure
- Universal Design
    - Usable by both Research Scientists and 13 year old with no technical trainng and not outside assistance
    - When things are accessible to *anyone*, **everyone** benefits
    - Keep the UX slick AF and accessible to people with Zero XP will also avoid bounding specialists (who are Zero XP relative to other fields)


- Software architecture capable of scaling
    - Cleaner code
        - Easier onboarding to projects
        - Easier support, easier to extend
        - Easier accept external support
        - Easier collaboration across fields
            - Good for science
            - Good for training
    - Emphasis on `architecture` 
    - Code written to comply with code standards (e.g. `PEP8 Python Style Guide`, `black` formatter, etc)
    - Paired programming/mentorship model 


- Future Proofing
    - Focus on 'core functionality' 

        - temporal syncronization
        - calibrating
        - UX/UI 
    - remain `hardware and software agnostic`
        - generic cameras ensure greater access
        -  Keep the buy in as low as possible, time to first :D low as possible 
        - Specialized hardware means you're beholden to whoever makes that hardware
            - Story of Kinect
            - Story of Intel RealSense
            - Story of Intel LiDar
            - Now people are building stuff based on iOS Stuff??    
            - Yikes
    - Make it work with generic hardware and then you can integrate more fancy things later using the same calibartion
        - LIke use Stereo cameras and LiDar 
        - Anything that makes `RGBD` data 
        - And just situate the point clouds on top of each other from each camera's location
        - You could probably clean then up with and Iterative Closed Point (ICP) algorithm?
