# FreeMoCap Project

## Community Support

### Challenge: AS the project grows, the effort of support increases
#### Solution: Build a strongly interconnected community that can help offset challenges of growth
### Building Mod team from power users
#### training in core competencies (see Educational Content)
#### 'entry level' work to support brining in help from No XP newbs
#### Teach them to make tickets and point people towards docs
### Branching Skill tree
#### like plot hooks
#### Greased rail into heart of the matter
### Community grants program? 
#### Internal voting via 'eurovision' model
#### Voting rights given to power users, based on accrued XP

## Technical Infrastructure
### Universal Design
#### Usable by both Research Scientists and 13 year old with no technical trainng and not outside assistance
#### When things are accessible to *anyone*, **everyone** benefits
#### Keep the UX slick AF and accessible to people with Zero XP will also avoid bounding specialists (who are Zero XP relative to other fields)


### Software architecture capable of scaling
#### cleaner code
##### Easier onboarding
##### Easier support
##### Easier accept external support
##### Easier collaboration across fields
###### Good for science
###### Good for training
### Future Proofing
#### Focus on 'core functionality' 
##### syncing, calibrating, UX/UI 
###### remain hardware and software agnostic
