# From `Project Synopsis`:

- The goal of the POSE program is to fund new OSE managing organizations, each responsible for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure needed for efficient and secure operation of an OSE based around a specific open-source product or class of products. 

- The early and intentional formation of such managing organizations is expected to ensure more secure open-source products, increased coordination of developer contributions, and a more focused route to impactful technologies. 

- Instead, the program aims to fund new managing organizations that catalyze **community-driven development and growth** of the subject OSEs. 

- The expected outcomes of the POSE program are 
  - (1) to grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and 
  - (2) to enable pathways for the development of collaborative OSEs that could lead to new technology products or services that have broad societal impacts. 
  
  - develop a sustainable OSE based on a mature open-source product that shows promise both in the ability to meet an emergent societal or national need and to build a community to help develop it (Phase II).```


# from Phase 2 Description

- The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source research product into a sustainable and robust OSE. 
- Each Phase II proposal is expected to include a detailed project plan to support the **community-driven and collaborative development and deployment of later-stage successful research tools into operational environments**. 
- The proposals must include a **community outreach plan** that 
  - (a) outlines activities to engage the intended contributor community that will help to further develop and maintain the technology, and 
  - (b) identifies an intended user community or organizations that will serve as early adopters of the technology. 
- Each Phase II proposal should describe the **current context and the long-term vision and impact of the proposed OSE.**
  - The proposal should also include
    - a well-developed plan for building an OSE including 
      - ecosystem establishment/growth,
      - organizational and governance structure,
      - community building, and
      - sustainability and evaluation plans.

# From Intro:

Some ok language, nothing too strategic

# Program Description 

- The purpose of the POSE program is to [support] managing organizations that facilitate the creation and growth of sustainable, high-impact OSEs around already-developed open-source products,  
- The POSE program aims to 
  - (1) grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and
  - (2) enable pathways to intentionally transition promising mature open-source research projects into self-sustaining OSEs that could lead to **new technology products or services with broad societal impacts.**
- The transition from an open-source research project to an OSE requires an organized and intentional approach that depends on many factors. These include 
  - (1) the guiding principles and vision of the team founding the organization, 
  - (2) the specific open-source product being developed, 
  - (3) the market demand for this product within the current technological landscape, 
  - (4) the need for adaptability and flexibility in deployment scenarios, 
  - (5) a distributed community of contributors who will drive the collaborative development of the technology, and 
  - (6) a community of users who will serve as early adopters of the technology. 
- OSEs are generally supported by an **international community of users and developers** from different entities including
  - academia,
  - non-profit, and 
  - industry. 
- POSE strongly encourages proposers to consider mechanisms to intentionally involve all these groups, including international collaborators.
# REQUIRED components

- The last line of the Project Summary section must consist of a prioritized list of 1-5 keywords that best characterize the broad technical area and applications that the OSE will target. The first keyword must denote the directorate [Biological Sciences (specified as “BIO”), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), or Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)] that most closely matches the technical topic advanced in the OSE.
- The Project Description section must have a separate section titled `“Context of OSE”` describing the context and vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of the
  - guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, 
  - the specific societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, 
  - and the anticipated broader impacts of the OSE (note that, per the PAPPG, the Project Description must also have a separately-titled section on “Broader Impacts”). 
    - In addition, the section must have 
      - (1) a pointer to the existing publicly-available open-source product that is being transitioned; 
      - (2) details on the current status of the research product, development model, methods of dissemination, and user base; and 
      - (3) a description of the problem being addressed, and the novelty of the intended product being transitioned, including substantiating evidence of the technology's potential to significantly impact/address the problem. 
- A minimum of three and up to five letters of collaboration from third-party `users` or `contributors` of the open-source product must be uploaded as Supplementary Documents. These letters of collaboration must be from current users or contributors (who are not directly related to the proposing team) of the open-source product that is the subject of the proposed OSE. Each letter writer should 
  - clearly describe how they have contributed and will continue to contribute to the development of an OSE including 
    - the technical advancements enabled by these contributions and 
    - the value proposition associated with the product. 
- All proposals must include a security plan that addresses `all project-relevant security aspects`, particularly those related to the open-source products, such as 
  - data and source code including
    - data privacy and
    - code quality. 
  - Proposers are encouraged to consider the Open Source Security Foundation’s best practices. This security plan should be part of the "Data Management Plan" (see Proposal Preparation Instructions for additional details).

# Phase IIL OSE Development Awardds

## Ecosystem Establishment/Growth: 
  - Include a well-developed ecosystem` establishment/growth` and `ongoing discovery strategy` that ensures that the proposed OSE will 
    - further `develop the open-source product within the current technological landscape`, along with
    - specific plans to identify, engage and support potential users and partners who will serve as early adopters for the product`; 
  - specific plans to engage industrial and international collaborators are encouraged; 
## Organization and Governance: 
  - Describe a well-developed and sustainable `organizational`, `coordination`, and `governance` model including 
    - the licensing approach to be employed, 
    - the specific continuous development, integration and deployment processes and 
    - infrastructure that will enable the open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product and support sustainability goals for the OSE, along with 
    - metrics to assess and evaluate success, in the longer term, of the development methodology and 
    - processes for ensuring quality control, 
    - security and
    - privacy of new content;
## Community Building: 
- Describe a long-term strategy for community building to `engage`, `incentivize`, and `onboard` potential content contributors who will help in further developing and maintaining the open-source product;
##  Sustainability: 
- Articulate clear sustainability goals of the OSE, and 
  - an actionable evaluation plan, along with 
    - metrics to assess and evaluate success, in the longer term, of the development methodology, processes for ensuring quality control, security and privacy of new content, support for users, and onboarding mechanisms for new contributors.
